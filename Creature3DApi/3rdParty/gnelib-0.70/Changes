GNE 0.55 to 0.70
  Added ErrorCode User for user-inherited Error objects.
  Throwing exceptions during readPacket and writePacket is now allowed.
  RawPacket class was retired and replaced by the new safer class Buffer.
    RawPacket's name was confusing, and did not have strong protection against
    overflow and underflow.
  Fixed a extremely unlikely condition where a SyncConnection may be waiting
    forever to get its next packet.
  Major reworking of the connecting code, and added a state to Connection to
    help keep track of things.  These changes fixed some bugs including at
    least one deadlock, and increased robustness when GNE is shutdown while
    a Connection is connecting (so it can fail and quit early).
  Complete reexamination and major overhaul of event generation to listeners,
    and the synchronization that occured as a result.  Hopefully this will
    get rid of the deadlocks and hopefully most if not all of the remaining
    bugs dealing with connections.
  Fixed 2 memory leaks in Connection.
  Fixed overflow bugs in Time.
  The debug log isn't shutdown when an explicit GNE::shutdownGNE call is
    made.  This resolves some hard-to-avoid crashes when using the gnedbg
    macros.  Instead logging runs in its own atexit after GNE's.
  Added the PacketStream::writePacket method taking a SmartPtr.
  LockObject nad LockObjectEx added.  These work on SynchronizedObjects like
    gout.
  onTimeout events were being generated even when the timeout value was set to
    0.
  Like Connections and Timers, ServerConnectionListeners can live after
    being "lost".  The method ServerConnectionListener::closeAllListeners was
    added.
  Thread::requestAllShutdown, Timer::stopAll, Connection::disconnectAll
    methods added.
  optional clearOnExit param to Console::initConsole
  Thread::waitForAllThreads didn't work right at all.  How did I miss that?!
  Major API changes, see http://www.rit.edu/~jpw9607/gne/apichanges.htm
    There were a LOT of changes not listed here.  That document covers most of
    what is not listed here.
  Added Console::mclearConsole method.
  Added ObjectBroker, ObjectBrokerClient, ObjectBrokerServer.
  Added ChannelProvider and ChannelPacket to add in channel functionality into
    GNE.
  Added clock synchronization capability into the PingPacket class.
  Added copy constructor and operator= to Time class.
  Modified exisiting packet classes and examples to use RawPacket::getSizeOf.
  Added RawPacket::getSizeOf functions.  You should now use these rather than
    the sizeof operator when determining the serialized size of the packet.
  Added RawPacket operators to read and write GNE::Time objects.
  Added operators *, /, *=, /= for integers in the Time class.
  Added Time::getTotalmSec, to return total milliseconds time.
  Added a debugging system for mutexes which is active when compiling GNE in
    debugging mode.  It detects the following cases:
    * If you try to release a mutex you have not acquired, or if you try to
      release a mutex that the current thread does not own.
    * If you try to destroy a mutex that is still locked.
    The mutex now keeps track of a recursive count, and who owns it, which can
      be viewed easily when debugging by most debuggers.
  Added the ConsoleBuffer and TextConsole classes, a word-wrapping window
    that supports scrolling, and an arbitrary rendering device.
  Changed header include scheme to get rid of any extra header files I could,
    most notably my main goal was to get rid of forcing the user to have
    windows.h included indirectly through gnelib.h.

GNE 0.49 to 0.55
  Now features an interactive and intelligent batch file installation script.
    Run installmsvc.bat to use it.  Let me know if you have problems.
    Also has an installer for mingw, called installming.bat
  Calling getNameByAddress on an invalid address no longer makes an attempt
    to resolve it when it knows it will fail.  Before the lookup would take
    some time and return "Bad address" but now it returns "invalid address"
    immediately.
  Added Thread::yield.
  Removed the onWritingDone method from ConnectionListener.  This concept has
    been replaced by the more flexible and efficent PacketFeeder callback
    object.
  Added static methods in RawPacket for finding serialized string size
    suitable for using in a packet's getSize method.
  Added and implemented connection timeouts which generate an onTimeout event
    after a given time of idleness on a connection which can be used to
    discover dropped connections or slow connections.
  Added overloaded version of ConditionVariable::wait to wait until a given
    absolute time as specified by a GNE::Time object.
  Added the ConnectionParams class to help simplify setting up connections and
    to allow better forward compatability to ease the addition of expected
    expansions of abilities of connections.
  Implemented thread priorities for Win32.
  Ported the threading implementation from pthreads-win32 to use native win32
    threads.  That in conjuction with HawkNL's NL_WIN_THREADS option means
    pthreads-win32 is NO LONGER needed for GNE!
  Added MSVC.NET support by adding solution and project files.

GNE 0.45 to 0.49
  Added Thread::waitForAllThreads to verify the completion of detached
    threads, and updated the exthreads example to test/show this new method.
  Added a += operator to the Time class: operator+=(const Time& rhs)
  Exception scheme changed.  Exception specifiers were removed because it was
    found that they can be problematic with some compilers and cause
    undesired behavior with intermediate functions if they are changed.
    Catch statements should now catch Error& instead of Error to allow for
    polymorphic errors.  An Error hierarcy was added to better describe
    errors and increase client code's ability to handle and interpret those
    errors.
  GNE::Thread::getID is now a private method, because the underlying thread
    implementation might change in the future.
  GNE now compiles against the C runtime dynamically rather than statically,
    which is better in many different ways and starts to pave the path
    towards GNE becoming a DLL itself.  The examples are 1/2 to 1/3 the size!
  Small updates to the exballs Allegro example, which has been around since
    the first GNE release ;).  We almost forgot about it.
  New example/game expong.
  Fixes in the connection and handshaking process with error handling
  Slight fix in RawPacket when sending 0 byte strings.
  Fixed a bug in CustomPacket that did not allow it to be transfered over a
    SyncConnection, the very purpose it was most meant to serve.
  Added the ability to wait on a counter and decrement it, so that it is
    suitable to use to control or throttle the timing of another thread.
  Modified the examples a little to use the rate controls more/better.
  Implemented bandwidth control as per the GNE protocol spec.
  Modified the PacketStream API to fit the new rate control scheme.
  Created and implemented new Class, RateAdjustPacket, to implement the
    packet from the GNE protocol spec.
  Fixed a memory leak in the PacketStream destructor that did not properly
    free all memory for used packets.
  Graceful disconnects are now detected and handled through the onExit event.
  ExitPackets are now sent when a connection closes, as per the GNE protocol
    specification.
  Created and implemented the ExitPacket class.
  Fixed an event syncronization bug in SyncConnection that caused an assert
    to fail in onDisconnect.
  Now if a listener for a Connection is NULL the event thread is halted
    until a listener is set.  Before, it was an error to have a NULL listener
    but now you can set a NULL listener to temporarily hold events.
  Fixed an acquire/release bug in exsynchello's usage of gout.
  Fixed thread-related bug in ServerConnection dtor.
  Implemented PacketStream::waitToSendAll and added timeout option.
  Fixed a bug in ConnectionEventGenerator where it can try to start an event
    on a listener that was just unregistered, and this would cause an access
    violation as unregistration invalidates the iterator.
  Fixed a bug where a deadlock was likely to occur when a write failed.
  exrawtest updated to test endianness of the RawPacket.
  Due to a new feature in HawkNL, GNE now sends all data in little endian
    format which is consistant with the GNE protocol spec.
  Added Time::toString and the ability to output it to an ostream.
  New example exping to show and test PingPacket.
  Added ID attribute to every GNE Packet class.
  A new class PingPacket to handle pinging.
  Removed the timestamp value from the Packet class.  That should have been
    removed long ago.  Another packet will eventually be created that
    supports timestamps.
  A mutex was no longer needed in Connection and was causing deadlocks, so it
    was removed.  The mutex was left over from the old event system before it
    was rewritten.
  Handshaking as specified in the GNE protocol specs is now implemented.
  When an unreliable connection does not exist, packets marked as being sent
    over the unreliable packet stream are sent over the reliable stream
    instead.
  Added adjustCount function in the Counter class.
  RawPacket class updated to use the GNE protocol data types.  Nulls are now
    allowed in the middle of strings.  Max string size is 255 bytes.
  RawPacket example updated to better test new GNE protocol requirements.
  More work on exnetperf to handle more clients and better format the data.
  Added the LockMutex class as a convenience.  It locks a mutex on creation
    and unlocks it on deletion which is useful for use in functions with many
    exit points, or functions that throw exceptions.
  Fixed a bug with an assert being outside of a guarded section and actually
    causing errors it was supposed to fix.

GNE 0.4 to 0.45
  Fixed a threading bug in the Connection class that needed mutexes that
    caused problems on shutdown and startup.
  onConnect and onNewConn can now decide to refuse connections at that point
    by throwing an Error of type ConnectionRefused.
  PacketStream::run() leaked memory as it forgot to destroy the packets that
    were copied in PacketStream::writePacket() when it sent them.
  PacketStream forgot to destroy the data in its queues when it gets
    destroyed.
  The mutex class now allows recursive locks.  Previously not all platforms
    supported it, but you can make one yourself and I think the demand is
    more for recursive than non-recursive mutexes.
  Fixed memory leaks related to the previously described thread-related bugs
    in the connecting code.
  Fixed LOADS of thread-related bugs in the connecting code where errors
    might occur, espically if the connection was completed and all data
    transfered before the code finished (this is likely in the examples where
    only one simple packet is being sent).
  Added CustomPacket::getMaxUserDataSize to let the user know how large the
    hosted RawPacket can be.
  Made Timer more robust and safe to call from its callback and from multiple
    threads at the same time.  Also gave user option to wait in stopTimer.
  Solaris makefiles and fix script added.  Compiles on Solaris using the GNU
    tools and compiler.  Officially tested with gcc 2.95.2 and an UltraSparc
    processor, but should also work with Intel and/or gcc 3.x.
  getch() doesn't busy-wait and cause 100% CPU usage under UNIX anymore.
  Fixed obscure and ironically small race condition while setting the
    connecting flags which could cause recursive deletions and onDisconnects.
    Ironic because out of all of the code, the condition only can occur
    if the threads switched between two unconditional boolean assignments,
    but it happened.  I guess it was good to find it now rather than later!
  You can now delete the connection associated with a ConnectionListener in
    onDisconnect (previously you could never do this).  You can still delete
    it from any thread other than the EventThread at any time.
  Bugfixes related to Win32 Console I/O.  Now properly detects size in Win 2k
    and clears the screen on exit (to be consistant with curses, and to not
    clobber the command prompt if it exists).
  Slight modifications to the Thread API -- shouldn't affect user programs
    though but adds a few capabilites like overloading Thread::start().
  New and very much improved event handling system "under the hood" which has
    its own thread now.  This will fix a lot of threading-related bugs and
    cut down on the complexity of ConnectionListener implementations A LOT.
  Implemented and refined the API related to getting Connection stats.
  Due to some issues, Connection::Stats is now no longer a nested class and
    is now called ConnectionStats.
  New example exnetperf.  Don't pay attention too much to the values as it
    is still being completed.  When the GNE protocol is finished it will act
    appropriately.
  Added the CustomPacket class, which allows you to send data without
    creating a packet to encapsulate it.
  GCC 2.9x support!  MingW and GCC 2.9x in Linux should work again with the
    old libstdc++.  See the readme.mingw and readme.linux for more info.

GNE 0.003 to 0.4
  A new example exsynchello which is fully compatable with exhello and does
    the same thing, but with SyncConnection only.
  New include structure and method of inclusion, although more typing and
    perhaps less flexible, now works properly on all platforms without name
    changing and small cludges and hacks.
  Some of the examples make use of these new I/O classes even though using
    mprintf was perfectly fine to get some testing for these classes.
  Implemented new streambufs to be used with ostream and istream, so now two
    classes gout and gin exist that work even when curses is active, since they
    make use of the Console class I/O functions.  Both styles of I/O may be
    mixed.  The examples have been updated due to this change.
  Fixed a deadlock bug that occurs when GNE is shut down.
  Lots of improvements, additions, and optimizations for the Console class and
    API.
  Making GNE work with Linux out of the box.
  Added SyncConnection class for syncronous communications over a Connection.
  Added ConnectionListener class.  Events go there now.
  ServerConnectionCreator class is gone now.  ServerConnectionListener now
    has the needed function, and other event handling changes in that class
    as well.
  Completely changed the Connection API
  Added onDisconnect event.
  Improvements with Error generation and handling.
  Added test/example exaddr for the Address class.
  Added GNE::Address class which changes things everywhere, but is many many
    times nicer due to implicit conversions and encapsulation.
  Cleaned up exhello example, more complete code.
  Improved functions dealing with NLaddress, added GNE::addressToString.
  Fixed C callback in Thread so that Thread::run is now protected rather than
    public as it should be, and Thread::end is now private rather than
    public, as it very definately should be.
  Made ClientConnection::open a little more friendly.
  Modifications to the event system, onDisconnect event, and error events
    split into two categories.  Error objects now passed by const reference.
  A few bug fixes.
  Added the SocketPair class to separate shared properties between Connection
    and SyncConnection.
  Removed the OnReceiveEventClass.  onReceive events are now forced to be
    "non-blocking" as there is now only a single event thread.  Multiple
    event threads were found to be overly confusing and complex to the
    developers and users, with very little to no potential benefits.  If you
    need to "block" in an event (other than onNewConn), spawn a new thread.
  Created a new class, Error, that replaces the Connection::FailureType enum,
    and allows the user some shortcuts and a better way to get a textual
    description of the error.

GNE 0.002 to 0.003
  Renamed the Time.h header file to TimeGne.h to resolve conflicts with the
    standard header file time.h.
  Implemented an internal debugging system that is started and configured on
    the user's demands.  The user can also use functions to write to this
    conditionally generated log file.  Each message has a type/level number
    assigned to it, so you can phase out certain messages.
  Fixed deadlock bug in event handlers.
  More work on error codes and error reporting.
  ConnectionEventGenerator now creates threads for onReceive events
  New class OnReceiveEventThread
  Implemented code in Connection to parse packets and use PacketStream
  Implemented the PacketStream class
  Added PacketParser namespace with packet parsing functions, which will be
    used internally by GNE, but the user could use them too (but won't need to).
  New example exrawtest.
  Entire library now in the GNE namespace.  Examples updated.  GNE and Console
    classes now namespaces instead of "static" classes.
  New example expacket.
  New example exhello.
  Implemented the RawPacket class.
  Major API changes/additions/deletions in the Connection classes.
    This API is still very much in developement and working, so do
    not rely upon it being fixed right now.
  Changed examples to use new Console functions and GNE::NO_NET.
  Added function in Console to set the window title where possible.
  Added function in Console to get width and height of window.
  Special version of Thread::sleep(int) for Windows.
  Implemented the Counter class, and updated extimer to use it.

GNE 0.001 to 0.002
  Added a new example, exinput.
  Added an Allegro example, exballs.
  More functions in the Time class for working with Time objects.
  Basic MingW support.
  Removed GNE::exit(), when it was discovered that atexit and destructors are
    not called.  Now you must join all threads that might be running, for them
    to terminate properly.
  GNE and the Console portion shutdown automatically on exit now.  This was
    neccessary because the main thread might not be able to shutdown GNE if
    it exits before the other threads.
  Added the Console class, a file for basic cross-platform console functions
    used for the examples and for console-only based servers.  Examples have
    been updated to use this class.
  Added exuptime example.
  Added extimer example.
  Implemented Timer class.
  Added a buildall project for building the lib and all examples.
