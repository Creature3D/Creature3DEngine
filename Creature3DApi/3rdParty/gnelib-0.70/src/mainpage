\section beg Beginner's Guide to GNE

This section has some information that will help you get started with using
%GNE.  The purpose of this guide is not to teach you everything about %GNE but
instead as overview to understand the basics of how %GNE works and to point
you to the examples and documentation to learn to code for %GNE.

There is now available a new %GNE tutorial for making %GNE programs, meant for
the beginning user.  You can find it in the docs package or on the %GNE
website.  Originally this beginner's guide was the only help for %GNE, so the
tutorial overlaps this guide.  However, the tutorial goes in depth and
explains the code, whereas this guide is a general outline of the library.

Do not forget that there are lots of examples and tests in the examples
directory.  After reading this guide you'll probably want to examine the
examples to see some sample code.  exaddr, expacket, and exhello are good
examples to look at first.  The example expong is the first example game
using %GNE and shows the basics of how to create a framework for a %GNE game.

There are several parts and services that the %GNE library provides.

<ul>
  <li> \ref base </li>
  <li> \ref threads </li>
  <li> \ref console </li>
  <li> \ref core </li>
  <li> \ref highlevel </li>
  <li> \ref lists </li>
</ul>

Throughout this guide, there will be classes marked with a star (*).  These
classes are ones that you probably could not make program without using them,
and you'll probably want to learn them first.

Classes that are not listed are ones that are used mostly by %GNE itself and
you'll probably not need to use them directly in normal circumstances.

  \subsection base Base API

  The GNE namespace contains the functions you need to initialize %GNE and
  miscellaneous functions to interact with the library.  The base API also
  consists of the classes:

  <ul>
    <li> GNE::Time - to represent times and time differences </li>
    <li> GNE::Address  - to represent and resolve network addresses and
          names</li>
    <li> GNE::Error - to represent error messages </li>
  </ul>

  \ref toc

  \subsection threads Threading API

  The following classes are in the threading API.

  <ul>
    <li> GNE::Thread * </li>
    <li> GNE::Mutex * </li>
    <li> GNE::LockMutex </li>
    <li> GNE::ConditionVariable </li>
    <li> GNE::Timer </li>
    <li> GNE::TimerCallback </li>
    <li> GNE::Counter </li>
  </ul>
  
  Threads are used throughout %GNE.  You will need a basic understanding of
  threads to use %GNE.  You won't need to create any threads yourself, but
  you receive events in different threads from your game engine, so you will
  need to understand when to use mutexes to guard your game engine's data.

  For those of you who have used Allegro, the Allegro timers and their
  callbacks are done in threads, and so are %GNE's timers and events.

  Basically, what a mutex does is it only allows one thread into a section
  of code at a time.  You should use a mutex around a section of code that
  accesses any data on the heap (ie static variables or allocated using new
  or malloc) that is shared by more than one thread.

  For more information a link to a pthreads tutorial:
  http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/workshops/workshop/pthreads/MAIN.html
  
  %GNE uses pthreads internally.  You can pick up on threading concepts and
  examples in this tutorial although obviously the functions don't apply as
  you should use the threading classes.  You'll want to focus espically on
  the area of detaching, joining, and mutexes.  After you read that check the
  documentation for the %GNE classes to see the differences.

  \subsection console Console API

  The following things are in the Console API:

  <ul>
    <li> The GNE::Console namespace with C-style I/O functions </li>
    <li> The GNE::Console::gout object (works similar to cout) </li>
    <li> The GNE::Console::gin object (works similar to cin) </li>
    <li> The GNE::Console::acquire and GNE::Console::release ConsoleMutex
          objects for gout </li>
    <li> The GNE::Console::ConsoleManipulator class GNE::Console::moveTo </li>
  </ul>

  Standard C/C++ only allows for line buffered input and output.  It does not
  allow for output the same time as input, nor does it allow the user to get
  input without the user pressing enter or reposition the cursor.  These
  features are useful for game servers so that one can implement a console
  where the user can input/chat while other messages are being outputted.
  Additionally, the standard C/C++ I/O is not thread-safe.

  %GNE provides multithreaded console I/O which you can use to make
  text-based servers, consoles, or chat programs.  See the exinput example
  for sample code using the %GNE Console API, although every %GNE example
  makes use of the %GNE Console API.

  \subsection core Core Connection API

  This is the heart of %GNE.  The Connection API consists of:

  <ul>
    <li> GNE::Connection * </li>
    <li> GNE::PacketStream * </li>
    <li> GNE::PacketFeeder </li>
    <li> GNE::ConnectionListener * </li>
    <li> GNE::ClientConnection * </li>
    <li> GNE::ServerConnection * </li>
    <li> GNE::SyncConnection * </li>
    <li> GNE::ServerConnectionListener * </li>
    <li> GNE::Packet * </li>
    <li> GNE::RawPacket * </li>
  </ul>
  
  The %Connection API provides the classes to send data between computers.
  Connections in %GNE handle bandwith controls, do version and error checking,
  parse packets, and more.

  Learning this part of %GNE can be a little confusing at first as to what
  classes to use and when you use them.  The exhello example shows the
  minimum proper code to set up your connections.

  Connection is the base class of every %GNE connection.  While you won't
  directly create an object of type Connection, you will use the methods of
  this class, and espically the PacketStream that it contains.

  Connections generate events and send them to a ConnectionListener.  You will
  need to create your own ConnectionListener and a large part of your
  networking logic will be in this class.  The ConnectionListener is what
  actually makes the connection do anything useful.

  When you are ready to make a connection, you will need on the server side
  your own ServerConnectionListener to listen for incoming connections, and
  of course a ConnectionListener to provide the actual server's functionality.

  On the client side you will use a ClientConnection and a ConnectionListener
  to connect to this server.

  The PacketStream represents an outgoing and an incoming queue of packets.
  To get sent packets, use GNE::PacketStream::getNextPacket to receive the
  next incoming packet.  Use GNE::PacketStream::writePacket to send one.
  
  PacketStreams can also be tied with a PacketFeeder.  A PacketFeeder
  provides a way to feed a continuous stream of packets that is based on the
  bandwidth of the connection.  For example if you wanted your client to send
  update packets as fast as it can, but you always want to send the latest
  information, what you would do is create a packet, send it, wait for it to
  be sent (based on the bandwidth of the connection), and then repeat again.
  In GNE a PacketFeeder provides this sort of functionality.

  To send and receive packets, you will want to derive your own packet class
  from GNE::Packet and register it with GNE::PacketParser::registerPackets.
  Override all of the relevant functions in Packet and in the writePacket and
  readPacket functions will be the only place you are likely to use the
  GNE::RawPacket class.  The RawPacket represents the serialized form of a
  packet.  Use it similarly to cout or cin.  Seeing the expacket example is
  probably the best way to learn how to make your own packets.

  Once you make your own packet types and register them, %GNE will be able
  to recognize and parse these packets and be able to send and receive them
  through the PacketStream as it would any other packet.

  You only have to use SyncConnection when connecting, and even then, only to
  get a pointer to the Connection object.  But the SyncConnection is a
  helpful class to write connecting code or to do connections where you are
  sending a packet and are waiting for a specific response packet.  See the
  exsynchello example for a version of exhello using SyncConnections rather
  than the PacketStream, and further note that exhello and exsynchello are
  completely compatable with each other -- so they are doing the SAME thing
  over the network but are simply just two ways of doing it.

  \subsection highlevel High Level API

  The high level API will sit on top of all of the previously described
  classes and will be the actual "game engine" part of %GNE.  After the low
  level part is "completed" with %GNE 0.5, work on the high level API will
  start.

  This API will contain classes to manage unique player IDs and data, manage
  a list of players, and handle things like text communication amongst the
  players.

  \ref toc

  \subsection lists List Server API

  After the completion of the high level API a way to interact with list
  servers to search for games will be added.  Hopefully the %GNE team will
  be able to find a permanent connection and hardware to sponsor a master
  list service that anyone using GNE will be able to easily register their
  game servers on.

  The list service was meant to address one of the largest problems with
  independent multiplayer games -- finding others who have the game to play
  with.  The service will act as services like Battle.NET or Half-Life's game
  lists do.  Initially only a searchable database of current game servers
  will exist but afterwards chat/IM/login functionality might be added.
    
\section improve Helping with GNE

Development of a good API will require the input of many people to assure its
usability, performance, flexibility, and functionality.  If you are using %GNE,
I encourage you to join the discussions about %GNE on the gnelib-users list, or
simply provide feedback, suggestions, and comments on your experience with %GNE
to me at the %GNE website.
