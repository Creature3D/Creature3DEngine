# Library Paths include makefile

# If you have not installed your libraries or headers into the compiler's
# paths so that the -I and -L GCC options are needed, you can specify those
# paths in this file.

# Add a path to this line to give a specific path to Boost.
# Example path (Windows):
# BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH = "C:/My Projects/Boost_1_30_0"
# Example path (Linux): 
# BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH = ~/Boost_1_30_0

# Examples (Windows):
#

# HAWKNL_LIBRARY_PATH = "C:/My Projects/HawkNL/lib"
# 
# (Linux):
# HAWKNL_INCLUDE_PATH = ~/HawkNL/include
# HAWKNL_LIBRARY_PATH = ~/HawkNL/lib
